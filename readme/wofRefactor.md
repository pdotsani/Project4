# WOFRefactor

## Overview
This is part 1 of the project. We refactor Wheel of Fortune
to use some concepts of inheritance and interfaces.

## Running the Project
You can run WOF on the `WOFAIGame` class or the `WOFUserGame` class.

## Development Process
Conceptually, this part of the project took some time. Understanding the
nature of how Player classes related to the AIGame class was difficult at first.
Overriding methods and keeping track of what overrides what was also another challenge.

## Test Plan
Tested using multiple runs on both the AI and User interface.
